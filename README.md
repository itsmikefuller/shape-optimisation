This repository contains the code snippets and figures I used to put together my 2018 Rokos Internship research report on shape optimisation. All code snippets were written in $\text{MATLAB}$ and leveraged the [`chebfun`](https://www.chebfun.org/) package, allowing ease of parametrisation and visualisation of the level set functions used throughout.
